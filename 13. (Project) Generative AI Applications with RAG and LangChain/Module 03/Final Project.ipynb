Below, we outline the key\\naspects of the language modeling problem, particularly the goal of maximizing\\nconditional probabilities based on task-specific prompts.\\nAssume we have an autoregressive language model PΦ(y|x) that is pre\\x02trained and parameterized by Φ. For example, PΦ(y|x) could be a general\\nmulti-task model such as GPT, built on top of the Transformer architecture.\\nThe model can then be adapted to different downstream tasks such as text\\nsummarization, machine reading comprehension (MRC), and natural language\\nto SQL (NL2SQL). Each downstream task is represented as a training set of\\ncontext-output pairs:\\nZ = {(xi, yi)}i=1,...,N ,\\nwhere both xi and yi are sequences of tokens. For instance, in NL2SQL, xi\\nmight represent a natural language question and yi would be the corresponding\\nSQL query; in summarization, xi represents the article and yi would be its\\nsummary.\\nIn traditional fine-tuning, the model is initialized using the pre-trained weights\\nΦ0, which are then updated to Φ0 + ∆Φ by optimizing the model’s parameters\\nto maximize the conditional probabilities for each token:\\nmax\\nΦ\\nX\\n(x,y)∈Z\\nX\\n|y|\\nt=1\\nlog (PΦ(yt|x, y<t)) (1)\\nA significant limitation of full fine-tuning is that for every downstream task, a\\ndifferent set of parameters ∆Φ must be learned, and the size of ∆Φ is equal to the\\nsize of Φ0. For large models, such as GPT-3 with 175 billion parameters, storing\\nand deploying multiple instances of fine-tuned models becomes impractical or\\nextremely challenging.\\nTo address this issue, we propose a more efficient approach where the task\\x02specific parameter updates ∆Φ = ∆Φ(Θ) are encoded using a much smaller set\\nof parameters Θ, where |Θ| ≪ |Φ0|. As a result, optimizing the model for each\\ntask reduces to optimizing Θ as follows:\\nmax\\nΘ\\nX\\n(x,y)∈Z\\nX\\n|y|\\nt=1\\nlog pΦ0+∆Φ(Θ)(yt|x, y<t)\\n\\x01\\n(2)\\nIn the following sections, we explore a low-rank approach for representing\\n∆Φ, making the adaptation process more efficient in both computational and\\nmemory terms. For large models like GPT-3 175B, this method allows the\\ntrainable parameters |Θ| to be reduced to as little as 0.01% of |Φ0|.\\n3\\n'),\n",

Since the rise of transfer learning,\\na great deal of work has focused on making model adaptation more efficient in\\nterms of both parameters and computation. For an overview, see Section 6 for\\nsome well-known works. Focusing on language modeling, two prominent strate\\x02gies for efficient adaptation stand out: adding adapter layers, or optimizing the\\ninput layer activations. However, both approaches come with limitations, espe\\x02cially when applied in large-scale, latency-sensitive production environments.\\n3.1 Adapter Layers and Inference Latency\\nThere are many variations of adapters. We focus on the original adapter design\\nfrom [?], which introduces two adapter layers per Transformer block, and a\\nmore recent approach by [?], which only uses one adapter per block but with an\\nadditional LayerNorm [?]. Although overall latency can be reduced by pruning\\nlayers or leveraging multi-task settings [?], [?], there is no way to completely\\neliminate the additional computation introduced by adapter layers. This might\\nseem minor since adapters generally have few parameters (typically less than\\n1% of the original model) due to their small bottleneck dimension, which limits\\nthe number of floating-point operations (FLOPs). However, large-scale neural\\nnetworks rely heavily on parallel processing to maintain low latency, and adapter\\nlayers are processed sequentially. This becomes more evident in scenarios with\\nlow batch sizes, such as real-time inference, where models like GPT-2 [?] running\\non a single GPU experience noticeable increases in latency, even with small\\nbottleneck dimensions (Table 1).\\nThe issue is further compounded when models need to be sharded across\\nmultiple devices, since the increased model depth requires more synchronous\\nGPU operations like AllReduce and Broadcast, unless adapter parameters are\\nredundantly replicated.\\n3.2 Challenges with Directly Optimizing the Prompt\\nAnother approach, such as prefix tuning [?], faces a different challenge. We\\nhave observed that prefix tuning is often difficult to optimize and that its per\\x02formance does not consistently improve as more trainable parameters are added,\\nconfirming earlier findings. Moreover, allocating part of the sequence length for\\nadaptation inevitably reduces the available sequence length for processing task\\x02related data, which seems to hinder prompt tuning’s performance compared to\\nother methods. We will further explore this issue in Section 5.\\n4\\n'),\n",

The impact on latency becomes significant, particularly\\nin online scenarios with shorter sequences and smaller batch sizes.\\n4 Our Method\\nIn this section, we explain the structure of LoRA and its practical benefits.\\nThe principles outlined here apply generally to dense layers in neural networks,\\nalthough we focus on specific weights in Transformer language models, as these\\nmodels serve as the central example in our experiments.\\n4.1 Low-Rank Parameterized Update Matrices\\nNeural networks contain numerous dense layers that perform matrix multipli\\x02cation, and the weight matrices in these layers typically have a full rank. When\\nadapting to a particular task, it shows that pre-trained language models pos\\x02sess a low ”intrinsic dimension” and can still perform effectively after a random\\nprojection to a smaller subspace. Drawing inspiration from this, we hypothesize\\nthat updates to the weights during adaptation also have a low ”intrinsic rank.”\\nFor a pre-trained weight matrix W0 ∈ Rd×k, we limit its update by express\\x02ing it as a low-rank decomposition, W0 + ∆W = W0 + BA, where B ∈ Rd×r\\n,\\nA ∈ Rr×k, and the rank r ≪ min(d, k). During training, W0 is fixed, and A\\nand B are the trainable parameters. Both W0 and ∆W = BA are multiplied\\nwith the input, and their respective outputs are summed element-wise. Thus,\\nfor h = W0x, our updated forward pass becomes:\\nh = W0x + ∆W x = W0x + BAx\\nWe illustrate this reparametrization in Figure 1. We initialize A with random\\nGaussian values and set B to zero, meaning ∆W = BA is zero at the start\\n5\\n'),\n",

Therefore, we use the same α for our first experiments\\nand avoid tuning it. This scaling method also minimizes the need to adjust\\nhyperparameters when varying r.\\n4.1.1 A Generalization of Full Fine-Tuning\\nA more general fine-tuning technique involves training only a subset of pre\\x02trained parameters. LoRA extends this approach by eliminating the need for\\nfull-rank gradient updates to weight matrices. Instead, LoRA uses low-rank\\nmatrices for adaptation. If LoRA is applied to all weight matrices, and all\\nbiases are trained, the expressiveness of full fine-tuning is recovered by setting\\nthe LoRA rank r equal to the rank of the pre-trained weight matrices. As the\\nnumber of trainable parameters increases, LoRA approaches the full fine-tuning\\nperformance, while adapter-based techniques converge to simpler models that\\ncannot process long input sequences.\\n4.1.2 No Additional Inference Latency\\nWhen deploying LoRA, we can explicitly compute W = W0 + BA and use it\\nduring inference. This means that when switching between tasks, we can quickly\\nsubtract BA and add a different low-rank matrix B′A′ without consuming ex\\x02tra memory. This ensures that no additional inference latency is introduced\\ncompared to fully fine-tuned models.\\n4.2 Applying LoRA to Transformer Models\\nIn principle, LoRA can be applied to any subset of weight matrices in a neural\\nnetwork to minimize the number of trainable parameters. In a Transformer\\narchitecture, the self-attention module contains four projection matrices Wq,\\nWk, Wv, and Wo, and the MLP module contains two more matrices. We treat\\nthe weight matrices in the self-attention module as a single dmodel × dmodel\\nmatrix, despite them being split into different attention heads. To simplify\\nthe process and improve parameter efficiency, we restrict our method to only\\nadapting the attention weights for downstream tasks, leaving the MLP module\\nfrozen. The effect of adapting various attention weight matrices in a Transformer\\nis further explored in Section 7.1. We leave the investigation of adapting MLP\\nlayers, LayerNorm layers, and biases to future work.\\n4.2.1 Practical Benefits and Limitations\\nOne of the major advantages of LoRA is its reduction in memory and storage\\ncosts. For large Transformer models using Adam, LoRA can cut VRAM usage\\nby up to two-thirds if r ≪ dmodel, since it eliminates the need to store optimizer\\nstates for frozen parameters.

It is not straightforward to\\ncombine multiple tasks with different low-rank matrices A and B in a single\\nforward pass if BA is absorbed into W to remove additional inference latency.\\nWhile it is possible to dynamically select LoRA modules during inference, this\\nsolution is not suitable for scenarios where low-latency responses are crucial.\\n5 Empirical Experiments\\nWe assess LoRA’s performance in downstream tasks across several models in\\x02cluding RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and GPT-2, before scaling up to GPT-3 175B.\\nOur experiments cover various tasks, ranging from natural language understand\\x02ing (NLU) to natural language generation (NLG).

This has led to the rise of ”prompt engineering,” a process\\nthat involves crafting and fine-tuning the input prompts to maximize model per\\x02formance on specific tasks. Fine-tuning, on the other hand, refers to retraining\\na model pre-trained on general domains to adapt it to a particular task (Devlin\\net al., 2018; Radford et al., 2018). Some approaches only update a subset of the\\nmodel’s parameters (Collobert and Weston, 2008), but it is common practice to\\nfine-tune all parameters to achieve the best performance. However, performing\\nfull fine-tuning on a model as large as GPT-3, with its 175 billion parameters,\\nposes significant challenges due to the large memory requirements and the com\\x02putational resources needed, making it as resource-intensive as pre-training.\\n6.3 Parameter-Efficient Adaptation\\nMany techniques have been developed to address the inefficiency of full fine\\x02tuning by adapting only certain layers or introducing adapter modules.

Our work can be combined\\nwith such methods for further gains in efficiency.\\n6.4 Low-Rank Structures in Deep Learning\\nLow-rank structures are prevalent in many machine learning problems, and sev\\x02eral studies have explored imposing these constraints on deep models. Li et\\nal. (2016), Cai et al. (2010), and Grasedyck et al. (2013) showed that many\\nlearning tasks have an intrinsic low-rank structure. For deep neural networks,\\nparticularly over-parameterized models, it has been shown that they often ex\\x02hibit low-rank properties after training (Oymak et al., 2019). Prior works, such\\nas those by Sainath et al. (2013), Zhang et al. (2014), and Denil et al. (2014),\\nhave explicitly imposed low-rank constraints during training to enhance model\\nefficiency. However, our approach differs in that we apply low-rank updates to\\nfrozen pre-trained models, making it highly effective for task-specific adapta\\x02tion. Neural networks with low-rank structures have been shown to outperform\\nclassical methods such as finite-width neural tangent kernels (Allen-Zhu et al.,\\n2019; Li and Liang, 2018), and low-rank adaptations are particularly useful in\\nadversarial training scenarios (Allen-Zhu and Li, 2020). This makes our pro\\x02posed low-rank adaptation well-grounded in both theory and practice.\\n7 Analyzing Low-Rank Adaptations\\nIn light of the demonstrated benefits of LoRA, we aim to further explore the\\nattributes of low-rank adaptation as applied to various downstream tasks. The\\nlow-rank structure does not only reduce the hardware requirements for conduct\\x02ing parallel experiments, but it also provides better insight into how adapted\\nweights align with pre-trained weights. Our focus lies on GPT-3 175B, where\\nwe managed to significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters (up to\\n10,000×) without sacrificing task performance.\\nIn this section, we address some key questions:\\n• 1) With a constrained parameter budget, which weight matrices should\\nbe adapted to achieve the best downstream task performance?\\n• 2) Is the adapted matrix ∆W truly rank-deficient, and if so, what rank is\\noptimal for practical use?\\n• 3) How is ∆W related to the pre-trained weights W? Does ∆W exhibit\\nhigh correlation with W, and what is the comparative size of ∆W to W?\\nThe answers to these questions provide valuable insights for optimizing pre\\x02trained models for downstream tasks.\\n7.1 Selecting Optimal Weight Matrices for LoRA\\nTo optimize performance under a limited parameter budget, we explore adapting\\ndifferent weight matrices within the self-attention module of the Transformer.\\n10\\n'),\n",
